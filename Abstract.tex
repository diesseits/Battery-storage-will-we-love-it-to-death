The advent of cost effective storage of electricity may create profound (and profoundly positive) shifts in the way that electricity is generated, distributed and consumed. Australia is being targeted as an early adopter market for such batteries and will be the first to grapple with many of the regulatory challenges this presents. This paper outlines some of the challenges and, particularly, where different arms of energy policy/regulation may interact with each other in ways that confounds, mutes or amplifies the effects of individual policy measures.
